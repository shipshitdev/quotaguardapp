## Development

### Linting and Formatting

This project uses SwiftLint and SwiftFormat for code quality.

**Run SwiftLint:**
```bash
swiftlint
```

**Run SwiftFormat:**
```bash
swiftformat .
```

**Xcode Integration:**

To run linting on every build, add a "Run Script Phase" to your target:

1. Select your target in Xcode
2. Go to Build Phases
3. Click "+" and add "New Run Script Phase"
4. Add this script:
   ```bash
   if which swiftlint > /dev/null; then
     swiftlint
   else
     echo "warning: SwiftLint not installed, download from https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint"
   fi
   ```
