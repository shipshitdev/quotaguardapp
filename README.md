## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew tap shipshitdev/tap
brew install --cask quotaguard
```

To update:
```bash
brew upgrade --cask quotaguard
```

### Manual Download

Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/shipshitdev/quotaguardapp/releases) page.

> **Note**: Since the app isn't notarized, you may need to right-click and select "Open" the first time, or run:
> ```bash
> xattr -cr /Applications/QuotaGuard.app
> ```

### Build from Source

Prerequisites: macOS 13.0+, Xcode 15.0+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shipshitdev/quotaguardapp.git
cd quotaguardapp
open QuotaGuard.xcodeproj
# Build and run (Cmd+R)
```

## Setup

### Claude Code

1. Install Claude Code CLI: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
2. Log in: `claude login`
3. The app automatically reads credentials from `~/.claude/`

### Codex CLI

1. Install Codex CLI: `npm install -g @openai/codex`
2. Log in: `codex login`
3. Select your team/workspace when prompted
4. The app automatically reads credentials from `~/.codex/auth.json`

### Cursor

1. Install and log into Cursor IDE
2. The app automatically reads from Cursor's local database

## Usage

1. **Launch the app** - It appears in your menu bar
2. **Click the icon** - See all your usage metrics
3. **Click a card header** - Expand/collapse to see details
4. **Refresh** - Click the refresh icon to update metrics

### Understanding the Display

**Collapsed view**: Shows service name + compact progress bar for quick status

**Expanded view**: Shows detailed metrics:
- Usage percentage and progress bar
- Reset time (when limits refresh)
- Subscription type badge

### Status Colors

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Green | < 50% used - plenty remaining |
| Yellow | 50-80% used - approaching limit |
| Red | > 80% used - near or at limit |

## CLI Tool

Quota Guard includes a command-line tool for scripts and automation.

```bash
# Show current usage
quotaguard usage

# JSON output for scripts
quotaguard usage --json

# Filter by provider
quotaguard usage --provider claude

# Show token costs (last 30 days)
quotaguard cost

# Cost for specific period
quotaguard cost --days 7 --json
```

The CLI is automatically installed when using Homebrew. For manual installs, it's located at:
```
/Applications/Quota Guard.app/Contents/Helpers/quotaguard
```

## How It Works

Quota Guard reads authentication tokens from local files created by CLI tools:

```
~/.claude.ai/            # Claude Code OAuth
~/.codex/auth.json       # Codex CLI OAuth
~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/  # Cursor local DB
```

It then calls the respective APIs to fetch current usage data:
- Claude: `https://api.anthropic.com/settings/usage`
- Codex: `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`
- Cursor: Local SQLite queries

**No API keys are stored** - the app uses the same OAuth tokens as the CLI tools.

## Privacy & Security

- All credentials remain in their original locations (managed by CLI tools)
- No data sent to external servers (only official API calls)
- Sandboxed app with minimal file system access
- Open source for full transparency

## Architecture

- **SwiftUI** - Modern declarative UI
- **Combine** - Reactive data flow
- **App Sandbox** - Secure with specific entitlements for credential access
- **URLSession** - Native networking

## Troubleshooting

### "Not configured" for a service

Make sure you're logged into the CLI tool:
```bash
claude login   # For Claude Code
codex login    # For Codex CLI
```

### Codex showing "Free" instead of Team

Run `codex logout && codex login` and select your team workspace when prompted.

### App can't read credentials

The app needs sandbox exceptions to read CLI credential files. Rebuild from source if using a modified entitlements file.
